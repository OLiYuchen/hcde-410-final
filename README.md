## **Project Summary**

This project aims to identify and analyze key risk factors associated with asthma development by examining demographic, medical, and environmental variables, using the Asthma Disease Dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to enhance understanding of asthma predictors and support the development of tailored, preventive public health strategies.

The report and coding process for the project can be seen [here](hcde410/hcde-410-final/Asthma_Risk_Factors_Analysis.ipynb).

## **Motivation and Problem Statement**

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that impacts millions globally, leading to substantial health care costs and a reduced quality of life for those affected. Identifying the factors that contribute to asthma development is crucial for preventive measures, especially among high-risk populations. Inspiration for this project comes from  my asthma experience after developing pet allergy. This analysis aims to examine data related to asthma patients to determine and prioritize the risk factors most associated with asthma onset. From a scientific and human-centered perspective, understanding these risk factors can enhance screening processes and support the development of preventive strategies.

This project will explore correlations between variables like demographics, medical history, and environmental exposure, all available in the chosen dataset. By conducting this analysis, I hope to gain insights into key predictors of asthma, which could inform public health initiatives and individual preventive efforts.
