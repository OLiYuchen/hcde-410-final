# Final Project Proposal: Identifying Risk Factors for Asthma Development

## Motivation and Problem Statement

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that impacts millions globally, leading to substantial health care costs and a reduced quality of life for those affected. Identifying the factors that contribute to asthma development is crucial for preventive measures, especially among high-risk populations. Inspiration for this project comes from  my asthma experience after developing pet allergy. This analysis aims to examine data related to asthma patients to determine and prioritize the risk factors most associated with asthma onset. From a scientific and human-centered perspective, understanding these risk factors can enhance screening processes and support the development of preventive strategies.

This project will explore correlations between variables like demographics, medical history, and environmental exposure, all available in the chosen dataset. By conducting this analysis, I hope to gain insights into key predictors of asthma, which could inform public health initiatives and individual preventive efforts.

## Data Selected for Analysis

- **Dataset:** [Asthma Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/asthma-disease-dataset)
- **Description:** This dataset includes patient demographic data, medical histories, and treatment information for asthma patients. Key fields cover age, gender, family history, environmental exposures, allergy, and other medical conditions, all essential for analyzing factors related to asthma development.
- **License:** [Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
- **Ethical Considerations:** Since this dataset contains health-related information, it is crucial to handle the data responsibly, with respect to privacy and ethical guidelines, ensuring all analyses are conducted within the data usage terms provided by Kaggle.

## Unknowns and Dependencies

The project depends on the quality and completeness of the data. Missing or inconsistent values could lead to bias. Additionally, some risk factors may be underrepresented or absent, affecting the comprehensiveness of the analysis. Access to supplementary data may be necessary if critical variables are lacking, which could add dependencies outside my control.
